3	North African Chickpea Soup	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/North-African-Chickpea-Soup-653275.jpg	<ol><li>In a large soup pot add the oil, onions and celery.  Cook over medium low heat until translucent.  Add the garlic and saute until fragrant.   Add the tomato paste and harissa.  Cook a minute then add the water or stock slowly while stirring to combine the flavor paste in the pot with the liquids.  Throw in the chickpeas and bring to a boil.  As soon as it reaches a boil, reduce heat to a simmer.</li><li>Add the pasta and cook according to the package directions.  My suggestion is that if you are using fresh pasta, give it a rinse under tap water to remove the starch before adding it to the soup.  It might make the broth cloudy.  If using rice noodles add them right before serving to prevent overcooked mushy noodles.  To cook rice noodles place them in a shallow dish and cover with hot water for 10-15 minutes to soften.</li><li>Just before serving taste for seasoning, adjust to your taste.  Adding too much salt earlier on could make things too salty because some of the ingredients can bring a lot of salt to the pot.  Then add the spinach, it will only take a minute to shrink into nearly nothing, but it is sure a powerhouse vegetable that amps up the nutrition in this meal quickly and without fuss.  A squeeze of fresh lemon juice after it has been taken off the heat will add a nice bright flavor to perk up those dreary dark days of winter.  Enjoy with some crusty bread.  A meal you can feel good about, filling yet light.</li></ol>	african	45	4	t	t	f	t

70	Jean's Seafood Gumbo	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Jeans-Seafood-Gumbo-648524.jpg	<ol><li>Fill a 14-16-quart pot with two quarts of water and bring to a boil.</li><li>Meanwhile, peel and devein the shrimp, keeping the heads and hulls. Set the shrimp aside in cold water. In the large "gumbo pot" boil heads and hulls for 30 minutes to an hour. This will give you Creole gumbo. Strain shrimp heads and hulls from stock and set aside. Discard heads and hull immediately. Otherwise, the next day your kitchen will smell like Bayou St. John.</li><li>Clean the fresh crabs  If the crabs are fresh, you must take time to clean them. Discard the hard back shell and some of the so-called "dead man," or yellow insides. Clean and separate crabs and set aside. (Note: If necessary, you can use meat from king, Dungeness, snow or stone crabs for your gumbo).</li><li>Before you fire up the stove again, cut up your celery, parsley, peppers, onions and garlic, especially if you're alone and there is no one to help you stir the pots. It takes time peeling the onions and garlic  Put the celery and parsley in a separate container from the other chopped ingredients and refrigerate until needed to keep them fresh.</li><li>Place the gumbo pot with the shrimp stock on the stove. Add cleaned crabs and bay leaves. Stir slowly. You don't want your shrimp stock messing up the floor. Add celery, parsley, and tomato paste to the gumbo brewing on the stove. Bring to a boil. Turn down heat, cover, and let simmer.</li><li>Here comes the roux -- a thick and flavorful sauce that has become one of the most important staples of Louisiana cuisine. Pour oil or shortening into a separate heavy skillet (please do not use a thin omelet pan) over a medium-low heat. Slowly stir in flour to make the roux. Keep your eyes on the skillet. If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy. If black specks appear, the roux is burned. Throw it out and start from scratch. A good roux could take 30 to 45 minutes cooking time.</li><li>Now you are ready to add the holy trinity of onions, garlic, and green peppers to the roux mixture. Stir ingredients in slowly because the flour is still sizzling. The moisture will begin to disappear. This is when Jean would add another quart or two of water to the gumbo pot. Add roux to the gumbo pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and cover. The kitchen should smell good right now. Pour yourself another cold something-or-other. You're halfway there. Come back to look and stir in an hour or so.</li><li>Season to taste: add salt, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and any Creole seasoning you like. Don't overdo it right now. Let the roux work its magic absorbing all the wonderful ingredients. Gumbo is usually very spicy, but you can keep it mild. Remember, if you have decided to use andouille sausage it is also hot.</li><li>Fry sausages and okra with a little bit of the leftover grease. Sprinkle a little leftover flour if the okra is fresh. Add to gumbo pot. Add chopped peeled tomatoes, stirring until well blended. Add more water if necessary. The roux will keep it thick and tasty. Return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours over low heat.</li><li>Skim any excess fat. Add shrimp. Stir in slowly as you increase the heat one last time. It's time to stir in the fil powder. Cook another 20 to 30 minutes until the gumbo is thick. Taste and adjust seasonings one more time. Did I mention the rice? Seafood gumbo is served over Louisiana rice. Of course, you can substitute for your own favorite rice. Just plain old brown or white rice will do. Before serving, taste one more time and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat and remove seafood gumbo from the stove.</li><li>To cool down the pot before serving, place it in the sink with a few inches of ice-cold water. If needed, add additional salt and Tabasco sauce. If you can see through the gumbo to the bottom of the pot, work on your roux next time.</li></ol>	cajun	45	9	f	f	f	t

96	Mango Fried Rice	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/mango-fried-rice-716311.jpg	Wash your rice and bring to boil on medium heat with very little water as you are still going to cook it in chicken stock. Once the rice is slightly soft and the initial water has dried up, reduce the heat and pour in the chicken stock and cook till the chicken stock is all absorbed and has dried up. The chicken stock if freshly made will have some oil from the chicken so your rice does not need oil. Increase the heat and stir in the chopped vegetables and pepper. Add your seasoning cube. Finally stir in your cubed mango and serve warm with any protein of your choice. I�d say chicken but it�s up to you.	chinese	45	2	t	t	t	t

Preheat oven to 415 degrees (and if you have a convection option on your oven, I recommend using it!). Slice turnip and beet thinly (peel on or off...I leave the peels on), place all slices in a plastic bag (I just use the plastic produce bags from the produce section of the store), drizzle in olive oil, add your salt and garlic powder, and shake it like Shake N Bake! Lay roots flat on a lightly-oiled cookie sheet (or two) and bake in the oven to desired crip level, between 11 and 15 minutes. The thicker slices will likely need to be turned over if they're not getting crispy within 10 minutes or so.</li><li>While the chips are baking, make the hummus. Wrap the cloves of garlic in foil. Using tongs, roast the jalapeo and wrapped garlic over a flame (I used my gas stove) until the flesh is blackened, soft and hot.  When cool enough to handle, remove the stem and seeds from the jalapeo.  Place all ingredients (including jalapeo flesh) in a blender or food processor, and blend until ingredients are combined and there are no more chunks. You may need to use a rubber spatula to stir around the ingredients in order to blend them well.  Spoon hummus into a serving bowl. Drizzle olive oil on top and sprinkle paprika and turmeric.  Serve with beet and turnip chips.</li></ol>	greek	45	4	t	t	t	t

183	Beef Pot Pies with Irish Cheddar Crust	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Beef-Pot-Pies-with-Irish-Cheddar-Crust-634660.jpg	<ol><li>Make the pastry: Place the cut up butter pieces in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill. Meanwhile, in the work bowl of a food processor combine flour, sugar, dry mustard, salt and cayenne pepper. Pulse to combine. After the butter has chilled, scatter the pieces over the flour mixture (still in the food processor), along with the cheddar. Pulse about 10 times. Sprinkle half the ice water over the dough, pulse about 3 times, repeat with remaining water, pulsing 3 more times. Pinch the dough to check if it sticks together, if not add a tablespoon or two more ice water, until it comes together. Dump the mix in a large bowl and press it together to form the dough. Divide dough in half, shaping each into a 4-inch disk. Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least an hour.</li><li>Begin the filling: Pat the meat dry with paper towels and season with salt & pepper. Heat 2 t. oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until just smoking. Add the meat in a single layer and cook, without stirring, until the meat browns well on the underside, anywhere between 5-10 minutes (the meat will give off liquid, just let it evaporate - leave it alone!) Stir the meat and cook another couple minutes, until it looses the raw color. Remove to a plate and set aside.</li><li>Reduce heat to medium, add the remaining 2 t. oil and the onions and carrots. Saute until softened and starting to brown, stirring occasionally, around 5 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme and marjoram, cook until very fragrant, about a minute. Stir in flour, cook and stir about a minute. Slowly add in the beef broth and water, then the meat, along with any juices left on the plate. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, to med-low. Cover and cook, (adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a simmer) stirring occasionally until the meat is just becoming tender, around 45 minutes. Remove from heat, add in the Dijon and parsley. Adjust seasoning with salt & pepper. Set aside to cool.</li><li>Rolling out the crust, filling & baking the pot pies: Remove the dough from the refrigerator 10 minutes before rolling it out. Roll the dough out on a well-floured surface, large enough to cut out 3, 7-inch circles out of each half (save the scraps). Line each cup of a large-sized muffin tin with the dough. (It won't look very pretty, you just kind of have your way with it to get it pressed in there.) Refrigerate the filled tins as well as the dough scraps 15 minutes to firm back up.</li><li>Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees. After 15 minutes and the filling has cooled down quite a bit. Divide the mixture evenly between crusts. Divide the remaining dough into 6 balls. Roll out each piece wide enough to cover the pot pies. Pinch the top and bottom crust edges together to seal, and finish the edges in whatever decorative way you like. Brush the tops with the beaten egg. Bake 35-40 minutes, rotating the pan after 20 minutes. Remove from oven & let sit 5 minutes before (carefully) removing the pot pies from the tin.</li></ol>	irish	45	6	f	f	f	f

Slice the vanilla pod in half and carefully scrape out the vanilla seeds and add these to your milk mixture.</li><li>Simmer the milk slowly for fifteen minutes to let the flavours infuse.</li><li>Once the caramel is ready, pour into a cake pan and swirl it around to evenly coat the bottom of the pan. Set aside.</li><li>In a bowl, crack the eggs and beat together. Slowly pour a little of the warm milk , vanilla and lime mixture into the eggs. This will temper the eggs and prevent them from scrambling from the heat. Once the temperature of the eggs has been raised by the warm milk, pour in the rest of the milk. Pour all of the mixture into the cake pan over the caramel.</li><li>Cook the cake pan in a water bath by placing the pan inside a larger pan which is filled half way with water. Place in the oven and cook for 45 minutes to an hour.</li><li>Once ready, allow to cool and place inside a fridge overnight. The flan is then ready to be flipped over gently and served.</li></ol>	mexican	45	8	t	f	t	f

Repeat layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a phyllo dough layer.</li><li>Using a sharp knife, cut the uncooked baklava into 1 1/2 to 2 inch pieces. Again, adapt this depending on what kind of pan you are using.</li><li>Put your pan into your oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, until golden and crispy.</li><li>While your baklava is cooking, prepare your 'sauce'.</li><li>In a pan on the stove, combine sugar and water and bring to a boil.</li><li>Stir in agave nectar, vanilla and lime zest, reduce heat and simmer for about 15 minutes. Note: keep an eye on it and stir continually so you don't get a sticky gross mess in the bottom of your pan.</li><li>When baklava is done in the oven, remove and immediately pour the 'sauce'on top. It will simmer something crazy against the hot baklava pan. That's ok. Pour it on and then leave it alone. That means let it sit until it's cooled.</li></ol>	middleEastern	45	1	f	f	f	t

Begin by roasting the garlic, jalapenos and bell pepper. Leave the skin on the garlic cloves, wrap in tin foil and place wrapped garlic and all peppers on a cookie sheet; roast for 20 - 25 minutes, until veggies look puffy and skin is browned and flaying away from the flesh of the peppers.  A few minutes after putting the garlic and peppers in the oven, open both bags of collard greens, spread the greens over a cookie sheet and place in oven for 12 minutes with the roasting peppers in order to thaw the greens.</li><li>Remove the greens and roasted veggies from the oven; allow to cool. While cooling, crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl. Beat eggs, add the grapeseed oil and stir.  Once the greens are cool enough to handle, take large handfuls of the collard greens and squeeze all the water out of them over the sink. Once the water is squeezed out, put the handfuls in the mixing bowl with the egg.  Do this for all of the collards.</li><li>Using your fingers, remove the skin from the peppers, remove the seeds and chop into small pieces.  Remove the garlic cloves from the foil, remove the skin and coarsely chop the garlic.  Add chopped peppers and garlic to the mixing bowl with the collards and egg.  Add salt and crushed red pepper to the mixing bowl.  Using a fork, mix everything together until everything is coated with egg.</li><li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Turn the collard mixture out on top of the parchment paper.  Using a fork, press mixture firmly into the parchment paper. There is enough in this recipe to cover a 12 x 17 baking sheet, though be prepared to do a lot of pressing in order to evenly disburse the mixture over the full sheet.</li><li>Bake in the oven for 30  35 minutes until the edges are just barely beginning to brown and the collards feel dry and firm to the touch.</li><li>Allow to cool and pulling the edges of the parchment paper, place on a chopping block. Chop the bread into desired sizes. This makes 12 decent sized squares. Use for sandwiches, paninis, personal-sized pizzas or eat plain as a snack.</li></ol>	southern	45	12	t	f	t	t

Swirl the mould gently to evenly distribute the caramel to coat the mould. Make sure not to burn the caramel as this would make it bitter. A pale brown color is what you should achieve. Set each aside to cool down.</li><li>Making the Custard:In a mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients namely the egg yolks, vanilla extract, white sugar, condense and evaporated milk.

Fill each up at least just half high as the mould, because the mixture is expected to expand once it's steamed.</li><li>Cover each mould with an aluminum foil to avoid the moisture from the steam to come in contact with the flan.

It is essential that you do not change the amount of heat as this might cause uneven cooking.</li><li>Check every now and then whether the flan is already ready or not, with the use of a fork. Just gently poke the flan with the fork and you will know it's ready if nothing sticks to the fork as you pull it out.</li><li>Once you achieve this, remove the moulds from the steamer right away and let it cool at room temperature. Avoid overcooking the flan as this will make it hard and dry.</li><li>Once the flans have cooled down, refrigerate for at least an hour before serving.</li><li>Upon Serving:Unmould the Leche Flan by running a knife around the edge of the mould, carefully inverting it onto a serving dish, allowing the caramelized sugar coat the flan.

Use a 12 inch All-Clad stainless steel pan or equivalent. A paella pan is not necessary.</li><li>2. Mix the Spice Mix and rub on the chicken and refrigerate for 1 hour. Let the chicken warm up for 30 minutes before cooking.</li><li>3. Heat half of the oil in the pan to medium high heat and brown the sausage rounds, then reserve.</li><li>4. Add the remaining oil and chicken and brown on all sides, then reserve.</li><li>5. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions, garlic and parsley to start the sofrito. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes then add the crushed and drained tomatoes and cook for about 3 minutes while flavors meld. This base sauce is the sofrito.</li><li>6. Add the rice and stir to mix thoroughly to coat all the rice; about 2 more minutes.</li><li>7. Add back the sausage and chicken.

345	Paella Valencian	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Paella-Valencian-654330.jpg	<ol><li>* Note: About 2 inches square; 1 or 2 of each per serving: 8 to 10 pieces of chicken breast and/or thigh, 6 to 8 pieces of rabbit, or 6 to 8 pieces of pork, meatballs, etc. (all optional, depending on appetites).</li><li>In saucepan, brown meats in olive oil; remove meat. In drippings, add onion, green pepper, tomato, minced garlic, bay leaf, and parsley and saute until the onion is soft. Add saffron, browned meats, and 1/4 cup of water and cook over low heat 5 to 10 minutes. Drain the juice from the saucepan and save it.</li><li>Steam mussels until they open. Save the juice; set mussels aside. When they are cool, separate the shells, leaving the mussels on their half shells.</li><li>Transfer saucepan contents to paella pan, distributing evenly. Place full head of garlic at center of the pan. Divide into pie wedges with the thick strips of red pepper standing on edge so that when it is done, you will see the tops of the pepper strips. Distribute rings and heads of calamari. Sprinkle beans or chick peas evenly around. Then sprinkle rice evenly around meats. Add 8 cups of liquid, including saucepan saute juices and mussel juice.</li><li>Cook, uncovered, evenly over low flame. This can be done in the oven, but is much better over an open flame where you can tend it. I prefer to do it over an adjustable grille, starting relatively close to the hot coals to get it steeping and simmering, but then raising the grille from the coals to slow the cooking and let the flavors mingle. Important: rotate the pan over the flame to make sure it cooks evenly, and keep flame from scorching the rice at the bottom of the paella pan. This pot takes considerable watchful attention.</li><li>When the rice has risen to the top and much (but not all) of the water has cooked off, fan shrimp over the top, then stand the mussels in half shells in the rice, points down. I do it in an attractive pattern of circled mussels and fanned shrimp.</li><li>As it cooks, gauge doneness by tasting rice from several parts of the pan to be sure it is the correct texture (cooked - not crunchy, not mushy) and consistent throughout. If more water is needed in certain parts of the pan, add boiling water sparingly, sprinkling from a large spoon. If too much water is in the rice, lay newspaper lightly over the top of it and it will absorb excess water.</li><li>Best served right out of the pan. In Spain, eating with the men out in the fields, the mussel shells served as spoons.</li><li>Serve with crusty bread and a tossed salad. I recommend violating the seafood-white wine rule; this meal goes best with a hardy red of your choice.</li><li>This recipe yields 6 servings.</li><li>Comments: I suggest the first time you do a paella that you stick close to the recipe. After that, feel free to experiment to taste. I also suggest you do not attempt a paella for two. This is a meal that requires a great deal of loving work to prepare, more than you would feel inclined to spend for only two persons. It requires close attention for quite a few hours. It cannot be hurried. I have tried to calculate the quantities required for six adults. There will be leftovers - there almost always are.</li><li>The first thing you need is a proper paella pan. You will find paella pans of many sizes and shapes. The best will be the most shallow and broad you can find, with its rim slanted outward. No lid needed. I have a paella pan that serves 8 persons; it is about 13 inches across at the top, 11 inches across the bottom, and the sides are only about an inch and a half high. It feeds eight persons comfortably. (I also have one that serves 16!)</li><li>The best way to clean and treat the pan: rub its insides vigorously with a wedge of lemon after each use (and before first use), rinse, dry, and wipe its insides with olive oil on a paper towel. It should remain rust free and ready for use.</li></ol>	spanish	45	1	f	f	f	t

After its cooled off for about 15 minutes, put the filling in the refrigerator to help it set for 30 minutes or overnight.</li><li>You can make the Empanada Dough while the filling is cooling off.</li><li>Mix the first 3 dry ingredients. Cut in the shortening with the dry ingredients. Works better if you use your hands. Add the eggs, milk and sugar. Continue to work in with your hands. Split the dough in half, wrap in plastic wrap and put into the refrigerator for about 20-30 minutes. Take out one half of the dough and split it into 12-18 balls of dough. Depending on how small you want your empanadas. I prefer one dozen per half of the dough. They also fit nicely on one large cookie sheet.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. You can fill your empanadas with any preserves made ahead of time.</li><li>Roll out the dough into small round circles. Add a small dollop of filling on one half of the rolled out dough. Wet the bottom edge of the dough with water to help seal the two halves. Fold over the dough to seal. Seal off the edges with a fork by pressing down along the two edges. This also makes for a pretty pattern when baked.</li><li>Brush each empanada with egg whites, sprinkle with sugar and puncture each empanada with a fork to allow steam to escape while baking. Spray a large cookie sheet with cooking spray, place the empanadas on the cookie sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes on medium rack in the oven. If after 15 minutes you notice the bottoms of the empanadas starting to brown, move the cookie sheet to the top rack and continue to bake for the last 5 minutes.</li></ol>	spanish	45	2	f	f	f	f

In a large bowl filled with water, dip a wrapper in the water. The rice wrapper will begin to soften and this is your cue to remove it from the water and lay it flat. Place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center and top with basil, mint, cilantro and lettuce. Leave about 1 to 2 inches uncovered on each side.  Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with the lettuce.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and ingredients. Cut and serve at room temperature with dipping sauce.</li><li>The Culinary Chases Note: The rice wrapper can be fussy to handle if you let it soak too long. I usually give it a couple of swishes in the water and then remove. It may feel slightly stiff but by the time you are ready to roll up, the wrapper will become very pliable.  A typical spring roll contains cooked rice vermicelli, slivers of cooked pork and julienned carrots but you can use whatever suits your fancy.  Enjoy!</li></ol>	vietnamese	45	4	f	f	t	t
