Preheat oven to 415 degrees (and if you have a convection option on your oven, I recommend using it!). Slice turnip and beet thinly (peel on or off...I leave the peels on), place all slices in a plastic bag (I just use the plastic produce bags from the produce section of the store), drizzle in olive oil, add your salt and garlic powder, and shake it like Shake N Bake! Lay roots flat on a lightly-oiled cookie sheet (or two) and bake in the oven to desired crip level, between 11 and 15 minutes. The thicker slices will likely need to be turned over if they're not getting crispy within 10 minutes or so.</li><li>While the chips are baking, make the hummus. Wrap the cloves of garlic in foil. Using tongs, roast the jalapeo and wrapped garlic over a flame (I used my gas stove) until the flesh is blackened, soft and hot.  When cool enough to handle, remove the stem and seeds from the jalapeo.  Place all ingredients (including jalapeo flesh) in a blender or food processor, and blend until ingredients are combined and there are no more chunks. You may need to use a rubber spatula to stir around the ingredients in order to blend them well.  Spoon hummus into a serving bowl. Drizzle olive oil on top and sprinkle paprika and turmeric.  Serve with beet and turnip chips.</li></ol>", "aggregateLikes": 1, "dairyFree": true, "extendedIngredients": [{"aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "unitLong": "ounces", "amount": 15.0, "unitShort": "oz", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "ounces", "originalString": "1 can chickpeas (15 ounces), drained except for about 1 tablespoon of the liquid", "name": "canned chickpeas"}, {"aisle": "Produce", "unitLong": "cloves", "amount": 2.0, "unitShort": "cloves", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "cloves", "originalString": "2 cloves garlic, roasted", "name": "garlic"}, {"aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "amount": 2.0, "unitShort": "T", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "tablespoons", "originalString": "2 tablespoons garlic powder", "name": "garlic powder"}, {"aisle": "Produce", "unitLong": "", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "", "originalString": "1 large golden beet", "name": "golden beet"}, {"aisle": "Produce", "unitLong": "", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "", "originalString": "1 jalape\u00f1o, roasted", "name": "jalapeno"}, {"aisle": "Produce", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "T", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "tablespoon", "originalString": "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "name": "lemon juice"}, {"aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "unitLong": "cups", "amount": 0.25, "unitShort": "c", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "cup", "originalString": "\u00bc cup olive oil", "name": "olive oil"}, {"aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "unitLong": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "unitShort": "servings", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "servings", "originalString": "Salt to taste", "name": "salt"}, {"aisle": "Ethnic Foods", "unitLong": "cups", "amount": 0.25, "unitShort": "c", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "cup", "originalString": "\u00bc cup tahini (sesame paste)", "name": "tahini"}, {"aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "unitLong": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "unitShort": "servings", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "servings", "originalString": "Turmeric, paprika and olive oil for sprinkling on top", "name": "turmeric"}, {"aisle": "Produce", "unitLong": "", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "", "originalString": "1 large turnip", "name": "turnip"}], "readyInMinutes": 45, "ketogenic": false, "veryHealthy": false, "cheap": false, "creditText": "Foodista.com \u2013 The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit", "license": "CC BY 3.0", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/fire-roasted-jalapeo-hummus-with-turnip-and-beet-chips-642893", "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 9, "id": 642893, "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Fire-Roasted-Jalapeo-Hummus-with-Turnip-and-Beet-Chips-642893.jpg", "servings": 4, "whole30": false, "lowFodmap": false}
