  "instructions": "<ol><li>Roasted Garlic Instructions:</li><li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li><li>Cut the top off the bulb of garlic, exposing the cloves.</li><li>Place the garlic on a sheet of foil large enough to wrap it up.</li><li>Drizzle olive oil over top of garlic bulb and sprinkle with salt.</li><li>Tightly wrap the garlic in the foil.</li><li>Place foil in the oven and cook for 45 minutes.</li><li>Remove and unwrap garlic. Turn upside down and squeeze the cloves out of the garlic skin</li><li>Whole Wheat Pizza Dough Instructions:</li><li>Place all ingredients (except 2 tbsp olive oil) in a food processor or a stand mixer with dough hook. If using a food processor, process until dough forms into a ball. Add extra water, 1 tbsp at a time if dough is too dry. If using a stand mixer, mix with dough hook until all of the flour is mixed together.</li><li>If you have time, place dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20-30 minutes.</li><li>Lightly flour surface and roll dough out until it is 1/2 inch thick. I chose to use a large bowl and cut out circular pizzas. This required me to roll the dough out three times, making 2 larger pizzas and one smaller one. You could also opt to roll it out until it is a rectangle.</li><li>Place pizza on pizza stone or on greased cookie sheet. Set aside.</li><li>Brush pizza dough lightly with olive oil (no more than 2 tbsp total).</li><li>Pizza Topping Instructions:</li><li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li><li>Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with non-stick cooking spray.</li><li>Place cubed red onion and sweet potato on the sheet.</li><li>Drizzle with 1-2 tbsp olive oil, and sprinkle with thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper.</li><li>Roast for 25-30 minutes, mixing the vegetables around occasionally. (I roasted my garlic at the same time).</li><li>Remove and set aside.</li><li>Take your freshly roasted bulb of garlic and squeeze the garlic out into a mortar bowl (if you don't have one, use a bowl). Crush the garlic with either a pestle or the bottom of a spoon until it is a paste.</li><li>Spread the roasted garlic paste over the pizza dough.</li><li>Sprinkle/crumble your cheese of choice over the pizza dough.</li><li>Place the vegetables on top of the cheese.</li><li>Cook pizza for approximately 20 minutes (plus or minus a few minutes depending on your oven), waiting for the crust to become golden brown.</li><li>Enjoy!</li></ol>",
