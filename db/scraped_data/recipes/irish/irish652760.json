  "instructions": "<ol><li>Discard any mussels that are open before cooking and any that stay closed after cooking.</li><li>Place a large pot over a high heat and brown the pancetta pieces until just golden and sizzling. Add in a knob of butter, allow it to melt and then add the onion and garlic. Cook gently for three minutes until the onion is soft.</li><li>Add in the cider and allow to bubble away for a few minutes so all the flavours mingle in together. Tumble in the mussels, cover with a lid and allow them to steam for about four minutes until they open, making sure to give the pot a good shake once or twice during the cooking time.</li><li>Remove from the heat and stir in the cream and parsley and season with sea salt and ground black pepper.</li><li>Serve with some crusty bread to mop up the liquid!</li></ol>",
