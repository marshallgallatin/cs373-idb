The corning of the beef makes the beef salty enough, so no need to add more.</li><li>Heat 1 TBSP oil in a large, shallow oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and sear each side for about 3 minutes, just to develop a nice brown crust. This will seal in the beef's juices.</li><li>Remove beef to a plate. Pour guinness into the pot to deglaze. Scrape up any browned bits. Add beef broth, pickling spice, brown sugar, bay leaf, and minced garlic. Bring mixture up to a simmer.</li><li>Return the beef to the pot with any additional juices that have accumulated on the plate.</li><li>Cover the pot and place on the bottom rack in your oven. Bake for 2 1/2 - 3 hours, or until a fork can easily be inserted into the meat.</li><li>Baste the meat with the surrounding juices every 30 minutes or so.</li><li>After 2 hours, add carrots, parsnips, and potatoes to the pot. They will only take about 25-30 minutes of simmering to cook.</li><li>Remove pot from the oven. Place beef on a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving into thin slices (cut against the grain of the meat). Remove vegetables and arrange them on a serving platter. Cover with foil. Place the pot on the burner and bring sauce to a boil. Add cabbage and cook for about 7 minutes, until it has softened. Place the cabbage on the serving platter with the other vegetables.</li><li>Strain the sauce in the pot and stir in 2 or 3 TBSP of spicy honey mustard until dissolved. Place in a small dish or gravy boat with a ladle and serve alongside the beef.</li><li>After slicing the beef and arranging it on the serving platter, ladle the guinness mustard sauce over the top to rehydrate and glaze the beef and vegetables.</li></ol>", "aggregateLikes": 6, "dairyFree": true, "extendedIngredients": [{"aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "unitLong": "", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "", "originalString": "1 bay leaf", "name": "bay leaf"}, {"aisle": "Canned and Jarred", "unitLong": "cups", "amount": 2.0, "unitShort": "c", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "cups", "originalString": "2 cups beef broth", "name": "beef broth"}, {"aisle": "Baking", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "T", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "tablespoon", "originalString": "1 tablespoon brown sugar", "name": "brown sugar"}, {"aisle": "Produce", "unitLong": "cups", "amount": 0.25, "unitShort": "c", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "cup", "originalString": "1/4 cup carrots, finely grated", "name": "carrots"}, {"aisle": "Meat", "unitLong": "pounds", "amount": 2.0, "unitShort": "lb", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "pounds", "originalString": "2 pounds corned beef brisket", "name": "corned beef brisket"}, {"aisle": "Produce", "unitLong": "cloves", "amount": 2.0, "unitShort": "cloves", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "cloves", "originalString": "2 cloves garlic, minced", "name": "garlic"}, {"aisle": "Alcoholic Beverages", "unitLong": "cups", "amount": 2.0, "unitShort": "c", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "cups", "originalString": "2 cups Guinness", "name": "guinness"}, {"aisle": "Condiments", "unitLong": "", "amount": 3.0, "unitShort": "", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "", "originalString": "3 spicy honey mustard", "name": "honey mustard"}, {"aisle": "Produce", "unitLong": "pound", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "lb", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "pound", "originalString": "1 pound parsnips, roughly chopped", "name": "parsnips"}, {"aisle": "Produce", "unitLong": "cups", "amount": 2.0, "unitShort": "c", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "cups", "originalString": "2 cups potatoes, boiled and mashed roughly (try to use the floury kind of potato)", "name": "potatoes"}, {"aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "amount": 2.0, "unitShort": "T", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "tablespoons", "originalString": "2 tablespoons pickling spice", "name": "spice mix"}], "readyInMinutes": 45, "ketogenic": false, "veryHealthy": false, "cheap": false, "creditText": "Foodista.com \u2013 The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit", "license": "CC BY 3.0", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/guinness-braised-corned-beef-and-cabbage-646034", "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 11, "id": 646034, "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Guinness-Braised-Corned-Beef-and-Cabbage-646034.jpg", "servings": 6, "whole30": false, "lowFodmap": false}
