You can read more about it here and here.</li><li>After cooking on dum for about 8-10 minutes remove the pan from tava and let it rest for about 10 minutes.</li><li>Thereafter, break the dough seal , transfer to a serving vessel and garnish with cilantro leaves ,fried onions & nuts [if using] .</li><li>Serve with raita and salad.</li><li>Notes:</li><li>Seasoning the water in which the rice will cook is very important else the biryani will be tasteless.</li><li>Be patient while the biryani cooks.Avoid opening the lid again and again and stirring while the rice cooks.</li><li>After dum cooking, it is mandatory to let the biryani rest for some time.Do not skip this step.</li><li>Enjoy!</li></ol>", "aggregateLikes": 1, "dairyFree": false, "extendedIngredients": [{"aisle": "Nuts",
