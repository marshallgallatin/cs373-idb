  "instructions": "<ol><li>Using your fingers, combine all the ingredients to make a uniform dough. If it seems a little dry (like mine was) add in a TSP of cold water until it is the correct dough consistency.</li><li>Roll out to 1/2 inch thickness  I was in a place with no rolling pin when I was making these so I used a wine bottle, it works really well if you are in a pinch!</li><li>Cut them into circles  I used a shot glass and that was actually the perfect size! They were either 1 big bite or 2 little ones, just enough at one time.</li><li>Dont forget to keep using your scraps to make more cookies.</li><li>Bake the cookies at 350 F for 10-15 minutes on a parchment lined cookie sheet.</li><li>When the cookies are cool, spread with 1 TBSP dulce de leche. If you want, sprinkle with either pink himalaya salt or sea salt. Enjoy!</li></ol>",
