Grease four 1-cup capacity ramekins and set them aside.</li><li>In a blender or food processor, combine 1 cup of corn kernels with 1/2 cup of milk. Puree until smooth, and repeat with the remaining corn and milk.</li><li>In a large mixing bowl, ideally one with a handy pouring spout if you happen to have one of that type available to you, combine the corn puree, ricotta, Pecorino-Romano, and eggs. Mix them up well, and season with salt and pepper. Now pour the mixture into the greased ramekins, leaving a half-inch of custard-free space leading up to the top edge of the ramekin to allow for expansion.</li><li>The most difficult thing about this recipe may be having to tell your loved ones that you're utilizing a bain-marie, and then explaining what a bain-marie is. Set your ramekins into a lasagna pan or roasting pan. Carefully pour in enough water so that the water level is half the way up the sides of the ramekins. Too much more, and you run the risk of water sneaking into your custards, and we don't want that. This is your bain-marie, or water bath, in which you will cook the custards for 55 minutes to one hour, until a knife inserted into the custard emerges clean. Carefully remove the bain-marie from the oven - we don't want any splashing on the exit from the oven, either - and allow to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. The custards may be served warm or at </li></ol>", "aggregateLikes": 1, "dairyFree": false, "extendedIngredients": [{"aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "unitLong": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "unitShort": "servings", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "servings", "originalString": "freshly ground black pepper", "name": "black pepper"}, {"aisle": "Produce", "unitLong": "cups", "amount": 2.0, "unitShort": "c", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "cups", "originalString": "2 cups corn kernels, from 2 large or 4 small ears of corn", "name": "corn kernels"}, {"aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "unitLong": "", "amount": 4.0, "unitShort": "", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "", "originalString": "4 eggs, well beaten", "name": "eggs"}, {"aisle": "Cheese", "unitLong": "cups", "amount": 0.25, "unitShort": "c", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "cup", "originalString": "1/4 cup fresh ricotta", "name": "fresh ricotta"}, {"aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "unitLong": "servings", "amount": 4.0, "unitShort": "servings", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "servings", "originalString": "kosher salt", "name": "kosher salt"}, {"aisle": "Cheese", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "amount": 2.0, "unitShort": "T", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "tablespoons", "originalString": "2 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese", "name": "pecorino romano cheese"}, {"aisle": "Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy", "unitLong": "cup", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "c", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "cup", "originalString": "1 cup whole milk", "name": "whole milk"}], "readyInMinutes": 45, "ketogenic": false, "veryHealthy": false, "cheap": false, "creditText": "Foodista.com \u2013 The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit", "license": "CC BY 3.0", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/corn-flan-side-dish-640085", "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 6, "id": 640085, "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Corn-Flan-640085.jpg", "servings": 4, "whole30": false, "lowFodmap": false}
