  "instructions": "<ol><li>Start by making the tomato sauce.</li><li>Finely chop 1 onion.</li><li>Peel 600g of tomatoes with a serrated peeler. Chop the peeled tomatoes into small pieces.</li><li>Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a sauce pan. Add the chopped onions.</li><li>Add a pinch of Pimenton de la Vera (Dulce), which is Spanish smoked sweet paprika. I used 1/4 teaspoon. Add more if you prefer the sauce to be spicy.</li><li>Add the chopped tomatoes to the onions mixture and stir well to combine.</li><li>Add 1 fresh bay leaf. I used 2 dried pieces here because I couldnt find fresh ones.</li><li>Add 1 teaspoon of sugar andd salt and pepper to taste. I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper. Adjust seasoning to taste.</li><li>Cover the sauce pan and reduce the heat to a medium-low and let the tomato mixture simmer gently till it reduces to a sauce like consistency.</li><li></li><li>In the meantime, make the meatballs by adding 1/2 an onion to a food processor.</li><li>Add 2 cloves of garlic. I used 1 tablespoon of minced garlic. Process till the onions and garlic are finely chopped.</li><li>Sweat the onion-garlic mixture in a frying pan with some olive oil. I just realised that I had missed this step. The meatballs still tasted great.</li><li>Add the onion-garlic mixture to 500g ground beef in a mixing bowl.</li><li>Slice off the crust of 4 slices of white bread. Cut the soft white bread into small cubes of 1cm all round.</li><li>Add the chopped bread to the beef mixture.</li><li>Add 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley. Use Italian flat parsley where possible. I couldnt find any, so I used English parsley.</li><li>Add 1 large egg.</li><li>Add salt and pepper to taste. I used approximately 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of black pepper.</li><li>Mix well to combine.</li><li>Shape the meat mixture into balls that are slightly bigger than the size of a golf ball size. Roll the meat tightly to form meatballs.</li><li>Add 3/4 cup of olive oil to frying pan. The layer of oil should be approximately 3/4cm in the pan.</li><li>Put the pan on medium-high heat and add the meatballs to the oil. Gently roll them around in the oil to brown all surfaces and ensure even cooking.</li><li>When the meatballs are a deep golden brown, remove them from the frying pan and set aside.</li><li>The tomatoes-onion mixture should have reduced to a sauce consistency now. You can use a hand blender to puree the mixture. Or leave the small bits of tomatoes and onions as they are.</li><li>Add the meatballs to the tomato sauce and let the meatballs warm through.</li><li>Garnish with more chopped parsley.</li></ol>",
