Pulse once or twice. Pour the yeast mixture.</li><li>Process the mixture, gradually adding enough of the remaining flour mixture so that the dough is no longer sticky. Remove from the processor; continue kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic (another 1015 minutes by hand).</li><li>Shape dough into a ball and put in an large oiled bowl, turning the dough to coat it with the oil.</li><li>Allow to rise until doubled in size (45 minutes to 1 hours).</li><li>Punch down the dough and divide into 2 pieces. This will make two 12 inch pizzas.</li><li>Shape each portion into a 12\" circle either by hand or with a rolling pin, stretching out as necessary to achieve a thin dough. For a lighter crust, let the dough sit for a half hour after shaping before constructing pizza and baking.</li><li>Spread BBQ sauce over crust and top with chicken, cheese and desired toppings. (I used caramelized onions, roasted red peppers and chopped parsley)</li><li>Allow to rest in a warm location for 15 minutes.</li><li>Bake in a 475 degree oven until crust is golden, about 20 minutes.</li></ol>", "aggregateLikes": 1, "dairyFree": false, "extendedIngredients": [{"aisle": "Cheese", "unitLong": "ounce", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "oz", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "oz", "originalString": "to taste shredded cheddar or mozzerella", "name": "cheddar"}, {"aisle": "Meat", "unitLong": "serving", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "serving", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "serving", "originalString": "to taste cooked, sliced chicken, cooked onions, red peppers, chop", "name": "chicken"}, {"aisle": "Baking", "unitLong": "ounces", "amount": 0.25, "unitShort": "oz", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "ounce", "originalString": "1 package (\u00bc ounce) dry yeast", "name": "dry yeast"}, {"aisle": "Baking", "unitLong": "cups", "amount": 1.25, "unitShort": "c", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "cups", "originalString": "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour", "name": "flour"}, {"aisle": "Baking", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "T", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "tablespoon", "originalString": "1 tablespoon granulated sugar or honey", "name": "granulated sugar"}, {"aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "unitLong": "tablespoon", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "T", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "tablespoon", "originalString": "1 tablespoon olive oil", "name": "olive oil"}, {"aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "t", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "teaspoon", "originalString": "1 teaspoon of salt", "name": "salt"}, {"aisle": "Beverages", "unitLong": "cups", "amount": 1.25, "unitShort": "c", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "cups", "originalString": "1 1/4 cups warm water", "name": "water"}, {"aisle": "Baking", "unitLong": "cups", "amount": 3.0, "unitShort": "c", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "cups", "originalString": "3 cups whole wheat flour", "name": "whole wheat flour"}], "readyInMinutes": 45, "ketogenic": false, "veryHealthy": true, "cheap": false, "creditText": "Foodista.com \u2013 The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit", "license": "CC BY 3.0", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/bbq-chicken-pizza-634485", "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 64, "id": 634485, "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Bbq-Chicken-Pizza-634485.jpg", "servings": 1, "whole30": false, "lowFodmap": false}
