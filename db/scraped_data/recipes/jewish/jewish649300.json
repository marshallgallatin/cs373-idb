  "instructions": "<ol><li>1. Skin the vegetables and in a standard food processor, grate them into a suitable bowl.</li><li>2. Take a handful of the grated vegetables and squeeze as much moisture from it as possible. Then place on a paper towel. Continue until you have squeezed out as much of the moisture as you can.</li><li>3. Clean and dry the original bowl and repeat the process of squeezing the vegetables dry but putting them in the bowl when finished. Then stir them to mix thoroughly.</li><li>4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg with the flour to form a sticky glue that will hold the latkes together.</li><li>5. Mix the sticky egg and flour with the vegetable mixture and form into flat pancakes about 3 to 4 inches in diameter then place on a cutting board.</li><li>6. Heat about 1/8 inch of peanut oil in a 10 inch cast iron skillet over medium high heat until a drop of water sizzles upon contact.</li><li>7.
