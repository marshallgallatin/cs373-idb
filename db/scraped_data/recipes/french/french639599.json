  "instructions": "<ol><li>Scrub mussels with a stiff brush, discard any that are open and stay that way even when you close the shell. Discard any with broken shells.</li><li>Soak them in cool clean water for at least an hour. Mussels are alive and breathing and have taken in sand over time. This allows them to expel the sand.</li><li>Mussels have a small fibrous \"beard\" that should be removed. Pull it out toward the hinge of the shell to keep from injuring the mussel.</li><li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the mussels, wine, buttermilk, butter, and parsley and season well with the kosher salt. Give it a good stir, cover the pot, and cook until mussels open and are cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Divide the mussels and the juices between 2 bowls and serve with a crusty whole-grain bread to sop up that wonderful sauce.</li></ol>",
