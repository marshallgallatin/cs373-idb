  "instructions": "<ol><li>Cut your vegetables and set aside (put mushrooms in a separate bowl).</li><li>Cut beef into bite size and put in a bowl. Sprinkle flour over and toss the meat around to coat lightly. With a large pot over high heat, add 1 tbsp olive oil. Wait for about a minute until the pot is really hot and add your beef (otherwise your meat will stay a grey color instead of a nice golden brown. If you do not have a large pot, do your beef in batches so as not to crowd the pot). Cook for about 5 minutes and turn the meat over. Cook for another 3-4 minutes until you get a nice color and remove from the pot (do not turn off the heat). Put aside in a bowl.</li><li>Add 1 tbsp olive oil to the pot and add onions, carrots, thyme and rosemary. Cook for about 7 minutes (stir frequently to keep the bottom of the pot from burning). Put the meat back in the pot and add wine. Bring to boil, lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add bay leaf, cayenne pepper, beef broth, and bring to boil. Lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li><li>Add mushrooms and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove bay leaf, season with salt and pepper, and serve.</li></ol>",
