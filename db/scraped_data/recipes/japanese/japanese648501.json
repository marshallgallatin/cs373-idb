Then use a big piece of foil to wrap the tin around from the bottom upto top of the tin side.</li><li>Place the butter, creamcheese and milk in a bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, being careful not to let the bowl touch the water, then wait until the butter has melted, remove the bowl from the heat and give it a really good stir until the mixture is smooth, set aside and leave to cool at the room temperature.</li><li>Add the orange juice and zest to the creamcheese mixture, stir to blend then add the yolks and mix them until incorperated. Sift the flour and salt into another mixing bowl,pour over the cream cheese and egg mixture in the center of thr flour. Quickly whisk or stir everything until just blended ( don't overmix or the cake will be tough) </li><li>In a seperate mixing bowl , beat the egg white with cream of tartar until foamy, then gradually add the sugar ,few tablespoons at a time, and continue to beat at high speed until reach the soft-medium peak ( more than soft but not hard peak). Gently fold the white into the creamcheese mixture until blended.</li><li>Pour the batter into the prepared tin. Place the tin in the preheated baking tray and bake for 50-60 minutes or until  a toothpick inserted from center comes out clean.
