Spoon the marinade over them until they are well covered, set aside for about 30 minutes, covered with plastic wrap.</li><li>Heat oven to 400o.</li><li>Line a baking sheet with parchment, and divide the kataifi into two neat rounds. Drizzle lightly with a neutral oil, and bake until golden and crisp. Remove from oven and set aside.</li><li>Meanwhile, place the corn starch, whisked egg whites and panko in separate bowls.</li><li>Roll each shrimp first in the corn starch, then in the egg whites and the in the panko. Pat them firmly with your palms to make sure the panko sticks well. Set aside on paper towels on a plate or tray. Repeat with the rest of the shrimp.</li><li>Fill a large deep skillet with oil (such as Safflower or Canola), enough to cover the shrimp when frying.</li><li>Turn BBQ to high. Meanwhile, heat oil in frying pan until very hot, and fry the shrimp, turning once or twice, for about 2 minutes until golden.
