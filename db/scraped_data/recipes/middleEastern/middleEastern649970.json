  "instructions": "<ol><li>Season your chicken cutlets (3 per person) or chicken breasts (2 per person) with salt and pepper. Squeeze lemon juice and drizzle olive oil over the chicken and mix until coated. On a hot grill pan, grill the chicken. Let cool and cut into strips. Set aside.</li><li>Stack your 3 whole wheat pitas and chop them into 2-inch pieces. Set aside.</li><li>Prep your vegetables and herbs and mix them in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. When it's time to serve the salad, squeeze the juice of half a lemon and drizzle 2-3 tablespoons of your olive oil and mix the salad until the vegetables are fully coated in the dressing.</li><li>Preheat your oven's broiler. Spray cooking spray onto a non-stick baking sheet. Spread your pieces of pita over the sheet and spray those pieces with cooking spray. That way you have the pieces lightly coated in oil on both sides. Add to your oven and broil for 3-4 minutes (or less depending on your oven's broiler). Flip the pieces over and broil again for 3-4 more minutes. The pita chips should be nice and crispy.</li><li>Add your salad to a plate and cover with pita chips and chicken. Garnish with a few sprigs of parsley.</li><li>I highly recommend toasting whole-wheat pita chips (the ones I used had flax seed) as a healthy alternative to croutons!</li></ol>",
