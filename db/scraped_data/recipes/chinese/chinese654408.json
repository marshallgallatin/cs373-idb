  "instructions": "<ol><li>Begin by making the dough. Combine water and flour and mix until all flour is just incorporated. Let dough rest for 10 minutes.</li><li>Next, make the filling. Mix the pork, chives, dried shrimp, salt and sesame oil.</li><li>Youre now ready to start making your wrappers and filling the dumplings. Roll out the dough into long sushi roll and cut into small round 1 inch pieces.</li><li>Use a small rolling pin to flatten it into a wrapper about 3 inches wide.  You are looking for wrappers about the same thickness as gyoza, so when rolling out your own dough, its pretty thin.  Its really an art  you make small balls about 1-inch in diameter, then smash down with your hand.  Roll the pin around the edges until you get your thin wrapper, leaving it a little thicker in the middle and thinner on the edges.</li><li>Sprinkle some flour on a clean surface on the kitchen counter.</li><li>Place each wrapper on the floured surface with the floured side facing up.</li><li>Put 1 heaping tsp of the filling in the center of each wrapper.</li><li>Wet your finger in the cup of water and wet all around the outer edge of the wrappers.</li><li>Close it by folding it up and pressing two wetted sides together.</li><li>Set it down on a flat surface and make the bottom flat.</li><li>After about 20 to 30 finished dumplings, you can set a non-stick flat bottom skillet on the stove.</li><li>Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in it and place the dumplings all around the skillet.</li><li>Add two cups of cold water, and then put a lid on the skillet. Turn the temperature to high.</li><li>When the water is dry, turn the fire to low. Take out the dumplings when they are golden brown and crispy at the bottom.</li><li>Serve with soy dipping sauce of chopped garlic, 1/2 c. of soy, 1/3 c. of rice wine vinegar, 1/2 tsp. of salt, 1/2 tbs. of sugar and 1/2 tbs. of sesame oil. If you like things hot, you can make a spicier dipping sauce out of hot chili paste, soy sauce and sesame oil.</li></ol>",
