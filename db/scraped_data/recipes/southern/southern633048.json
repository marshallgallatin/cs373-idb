Rinse each leaf individually under cold running water. After you rinse the collard greens thoroughly, stack several leaves on top of each other. Roll these leaves together. Then slice the leaves into thin strips using a cutting board and large knife. Rolling them together speeds up the process as you are slicing through several leaves at once.  With Kale and Mustard Greens, just break off the stem and breakup with your hands, after a thorough rinse.  Set aside.</li><li>Combine water, onions, seasoned salt, red pepper flakes and olive oil in a large pot.  Bring it to rolling boil, the lower the heat halfway.  Cook for 5 minutes.  Then add the greens to the pot until full, cover, and let it cook down (2 minutes) then add the rest of the greens.  Cover, turn the heat down just a little and let it cook - stirring every few minutes for about 45 minutes or to the tenderness you prefer.  Add a little water if needed during cooking.</li></ol>", "aggregateLikes": 1, "dairyFree": true, "extendedIngredients": [{"aisle": "Produce", "unitLong": "bunch", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "bunch", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "bunch", "originalString": "1 bunch each of the following: Collar Greens, Kale, Mustard Greens <", "name": "greens"}, {"aisle": "Produce", "unitLong": "", "amount": 3.0, "unitShort": "", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "", "originalString": "3 bunchs of either fresh Collar Greens or", "name": "greens"}, {"aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "unitLong": "can", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "can", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "can", "originalString": "All seasonings can be adjusted to your taste!", "name": "italian seasonings"}, {"aisle": "Produce", "unitLong": "", "amount": 3.0, "unitShort": "", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "", "originalString": "3 bunchs of Kale or", "name": "kale"}, {"aisle": "Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing", "unitLong": "tablespoons", "amount": 2.0, "unitShort": "T", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "tablespoons", "originalString": "2 tablespoons of olive oil", "name": "olive oil"}, {"aisle": "Produce", "unitLong": "", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "", "originalString": "1 finely diced onion", "name": "onion"}, {"aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "t", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "teaspoon", "originalString": "1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes (or to your taste)", "name": "red pepper flakes"}, {"aisle": "Spices and Seasonings", "unitLong": "teaspoon", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "t", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "teaspoon", "originalString": "1 teaspoon of seasoned salt (or to your taste)", "name": "seasoned salt"}, {"aisle": "Beverages", "unitLong": "cup", "amount": 1.0, "unitShort": "c", "metaInformation": [], "unit": "cup", "originalString": "1 cup of water", "name": "water"}], "readyInMinutes": 45, "ketogenic": false, "veryHealthy": true, "cheap": false, "creditText": "Foodista.com \u2013 The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit", "license": "CC BY 3.0", "spoonacularSourceUrl": "https://spoonacular.com/auntie-naynays-spicy-greens-633048", "weightWatcherSmartPoints": 2, "id": 633048, "image": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Auntie-Naynays-Spicy-Greens-633048.jpg", "servings": 6, "whole30": true, "lowFodmap": false}
